# **Captain Marvel Game**

### A 2D falling game created using Processing (Java).

Originally developed in 2019, latest update 21/10/2022. This is the first game I have ever made. It is a simple falling game primarily using the mouse to control Captain Marvel, as well as using any key to use her power-up. Collect crystals to increase energy and use power-ups more often. Destroying spaceships or blasts whilst empowered will gain you points. Progress to the next level by reaching 100%, or reach your highest scores using infinite mode.
<br><br>To play, download and install Processing from https://processing.org/ and run the CaptainMarvelGame.pde file.
